Vue based application for visualization of Rhino Grasshopper based 3D elements.



## Prerequisites
- Rhino 7 
- Â´Rhino.Compute
- Visual Studio Code
- Node

Run the Rhino.compute.sln - Visual Studio

When you have Rhino.Compute running, have a look at the number of the localhost. The example above has a localhost number 8081. This number needs to match the host number in the `source/scripts/compute.js` file (line 6).

If Rhino.Compute localhost number is different, adjust `compute.js` file to match it. 



npm install
```

npm run dev
